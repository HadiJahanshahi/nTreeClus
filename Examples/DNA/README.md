# Dataset Source:

The dataset origins from the paper named ``MeShClust: an intelligent tool for clustering DNA sequences'', including 15k instances. We implemented nTreeClus on the same dataset to have a comparison with their original method.

`nTreeClus-step-by-step.ipynb` file shows the step by step implementation of nTreeClus and its final performance.
